## Introduction

Tidy Tabs ("the Extension") is a Chrome browser extension that automatically organizes your browser tabs into color-coded groups by domain, category, or custom rules. This privacy policy explains how the Extension handles data.

## Data Collection and Usage

### What Data We Collect

The Extension collects and processes the following data **locally in your browser only**:

1. **Settings**: Your preferences (theme, grouping strategy, collapse behavior)
2. **Custom Rules**: Rules you create for grouping tabs
3. **Saved Groups**: Tab groups you save for later restoration (group name, color, and URLs)
4. **Group Colors**: Your color preferences for different groups

### How We Use This Data

- **Settings and Rules**: Used to configure how tabs are grouped

## Data Storage

All data is stored **locally in your browser** using Chrome's storage APIs:

- **Sync Storage**: Settings, rules, and saved groups sync across your Chrome browsers when signed in to Chrome
- **Local Storage**: Used as fallback when sync quota is exceeded
- **Encryption**: Chrome handles encryption of storage according to browser security standards

## Data Transmission

The Extension **does not transmit any data** to external servers:

- **No External Calls**: The Extension only communicates with Chrome's built-in APIs
- **Chrome Sync**: If you're signed into Chrome, settings may sync via Google's standard Chrome Sync feature
- **No Third Parties**: No data is sent to the Extension developer or any third-party servers

## Permissions Explanation

The Extension requires the following permissions:

- **tabs**: To read tab URLs and titles for grouping tabs by domain and matching custom rules
- **tabGroups**: To create, update, and manage Chrome tab groups
- **storage**: To save your settings, custom rules, and saved tab groups

## Data Retention

- **Persistent Storage**: Settings and saved groups persist until you delete them or uninstall the Extension
- **Manual Deletion**: You can clear all data anytime by clicking "Reset All Data" in the settings page
- **Uninstallation**: Removing the extension deletes all locally stored data

## User Rights

You have complete control over your data:

- **Access**: All data is stored locally and accessible only to you
- **Export**: You can export all your data from the settings page
- **Deletion**: Use "Reset All Data" in settings or uninstall the extension
- **Control**: The Extension only organizes tabs when you explicitly click a button

## Third-Party Services

The Extension **does not use any third-party services**, analytics, or tracking tools. All functionality runs entirely within your browser.

## Children's Privacy

The Extension does not knowingly collect data from children under 13. The Extension is a general productivity tool for organizing browser tabs.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The "Effective Date" at the top indicates when the policy was last updated. Continued use of the Extension after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
